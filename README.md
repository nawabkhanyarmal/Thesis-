🩺 **Automated Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis System**
**An AI-Driven, Portable, and Cost-Effective Healthcare Solution**
📌 **Abstract**

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness worldwide, affecting millions of diabetic patients every year. Early detection is critical, yet access to expert ophthalmologists and expensive retinal imaging equipment remains limited, especially in rural and low-resource regions.

This project presents a complete end-to-end Automated Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis System, integrating hardware, mobile technology, deep learning, cloud deployment, and an AI-assisted decision support system. The proposed solution is portable, affordable, and intelligent, enabling early screening and supporting healthcare professionals in diagnosis.

🎯 **Problem Statement**

Diabetic Retinopathy progresses silently and is often detected too late

Lack of specialist doctors in rural and underserved areas

Retinal imaging systems are expensive and non-portable

Manual diagnosis is time-consuming and subjective

✅ **Proposed Solution**

This project solves the above challenges by introducing:

📱 **Smartphone-based retinal imaging

🔍 AI-powered deep learning diagnosis

☁️ Cloud-deployed model for scalability

🤖 AI Bot assistance for decision support

💰 Low-cost and portable healthcare system**

The system enables early detection, fast screening, and scalable deployment, contributing directly to the global healthcare sector.

🧠 **System Overview
🔗 End-to-End Workflow**

A 30-diopter lens integrated with a smartphone captures retinal images

Images are sent to a cloud-hosted deep learning model

A CNN-based AI model analyzes the retina image

The system predicts the stage of diabetic retinopathy

Results are returned to the application with AI-assisted recommendations

Final medical decisions remain with qualified professionals
