🩺 Automated Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis System

An AI-Driven, Portable, and Cost-Effective Healthcare Screening Solution

Abstract

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a progressive retinal disease and one of the leading causes of preventable blindness worldwide, affecting millions of diabetic patients annually. Early diagnosis is crucial; however, limited access to ophthalmologists and expensive fundus imaging equipment significantly restrict timely screening, particularly in rural and resource-constrained regions.

This thesis presents an end-to-end automated diabetic retinopathy diagnosis system that integrates portable hardware, mobile computing, deep learning, cloud deployment, and AI-assisted decision support. The proposed system is designed to be low-cost, portable, scalable, and clinically assistive, enabling early-stage screening and contributing to improved healthcare accessibility.

1. Introduction

Diabetic Retinopathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and remains a major public health challenge. According to global health studies, delayed diagnosis is the primary cause of irreversible vision loss in diabetic patients. Traditional screening methods require expensive equipment and specialized clinicians, creating a significant gap in early detection.

Recent advances in deep learning and computer vision have demonstrated strong potential in medical image analysis. This project leverages these advancements to design a smart, accessible, and intelligent diagnostic system capable of supporting clinicians and extending screening services to underserved populations.
